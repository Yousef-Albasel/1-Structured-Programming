# 1-Structured-Programming
Welcome to the "Speed Typing and Algorithm Training" assignment! This project is designed to provide students with a comprehensive training on various aspects of programming, including speed typing, algorithms, flowcharts, program development, using libraries, and teamwork.

Through this assignment, you will have the opportunity to enhance your typing skills, learn how to design efficient algorithms and implement them using flowcharts. You will also gain hands-on experience in developing programs using popular libraries and work collaboratively with your team members to achieve common goals.

To complete this project successfully, you will need to have a basic understanding of programming concepts and a willingness to learn new skills. We have included all necessary instructions and resources in the project repository, so please read the README.md file carefully to get started.

We encourage you to work closely with your team members, ask questions, and share ideas throughout the project. By the end of this assignment, you will have improved your typing speed, developed stronger algorithmic thinking skills, and gained valuable experience in program development and teamwork.

Good luck and happy coding!
